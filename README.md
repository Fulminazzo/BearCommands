# BearCommands
**BearCommands** is a **Minecraft Library** designed to **simplify** the use of **NMS**, the **creation of commands** and **subcommands**, **saving custom objects** and **more**.
<br>
If you are looking for the **Wiki**, please go to the [following link](https://github.com/Fulminazzo/BearCommands/wiki): this page is just a **presentation** for the **BearCommands** project.
<br>
## The Story of BearCommands
My name is Alexander and I have been creating Spigot plugins since the beginning of 2021.
With time, I started to realize how much I have been **repeating** the same **chunks** of **code** over and over, until I decided it was time to **stop**.
I created **BearCommands** to help me **optimize** several area of **plugin creation**, while also for **learning something new**.
<br>
Keeping **BearCommands** up-to-date allowed me to always add **more features**, utilize other **platforms** (**BungeeCord** and **Velocity**), **work with NMS** and understand the major differences between **Minecraft versions**.
<br>
## Why make it public?
After having kept it **private** for quite a while, I decided to give it a go and open the cage of my little project to **people** that **might be interested** in **using it** and **reviewing it**.
I feel like **open source** is the way to go when trying to **improve your work** or **yourself** as a better developer, so I really look forward for **opinions** on **code optimizations** and more!

## What's next?
As [anticipated](#the-story-of-bearcommands), I do **not** have a **clear plan** or **path** for **BearCommands**, other than just providing it of **simplifications** for the **creation of plugins**.
I will probably work on a way of using it to create **GUIs**, **fully cross-platform plugins**, **socket connections between platforms** and more, but as of right now these are all just some **fancy ideas**.
<br>
If you have any **request** or **suggestion**, please **let me know**!
I am more than welcome to accept inspiration coming from other minds as I think confrontation is one of the biggest way to improve knowledge.
